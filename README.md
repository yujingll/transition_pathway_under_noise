# transition_pathway_under_noise
This is the code for obtaining tranisition path theory statistics using standard finite element method. The effect of noise is studied under different systems. Commonitors.jl and reactive_stats_struct.jl gives the function of obtaining reactive density where ferrite.jl package is used to implement finite element method. Other .ipynb files give the code for generating reactive density under different systems with different noise.
